## About The Project

These folders consist of the breadboard schematics and code to build and run the working IoT devices for its parent project: [IoT Smart Home.](https://github.com/brenwick64/iot_client)


### Built With

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started 

Below are instructions on how to build each device, as well as a common process to flash the source code onto each device using Arduino.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

Since the ``package.json`` file contains the dependencies, you will need npm installed.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
  

### Installation

_Below are the steps to install and run the client locally on yo._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/brenwick64/Bolus-Buddy.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Set your local API port in your `.env` file
    ```js
   REACT_APP_BOLUS_BUDDY_API=https://localhost:5000
   ```
4. Run npm start
    ```sh
   npm start
   ```
 


<!-- ROADMAP -->
<!-- ## Roadmap

- [x] Add Changelog
- [x] Add "info" section to explain form inputs
- [ ] Add accurate BG predictions to bolus recommendations 
- [ ] Add scoring for recommended bolus events to evaluate performance
- [ ] Convert to PWA for enhanced mobile experience  -->
